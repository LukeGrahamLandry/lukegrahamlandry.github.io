Like many others I've been frustrated by the lack of good documentation or tutorials on making Minecraft mods. I started making tutorials on YouTube but editing videos enough that they don't waste the viewer's time is time consuming and YouTube doesn't let you update a video to fix any mistakes. I've decided to make text tutorials instead. Hopefully this format will serve me better. 

All the tutorials on this site are for Forge 1.16.5 using Mojang's official mappings. 

If you've enjoyed these tutorials, please [join my discord server](https://discord.gg/uG4DewBcwV) to be notified of new tutorial releases and perhaps even [support me financially](/support).
